File 2 – Whisper Notes

1. Quiet Moments
   Sometimes silence says more than words ever could.

2. Paper Dreams
   Small hopes folded gently still find a way to fly.

3. Courage Keys
   Some doors open only when you decide to try again.

4. Star People
   Everyone carries a little light—some just shine later.
